        <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the
            Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male
            may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature
            female is called a pullet. Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China according to estimations in
            the study of the sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period 
            (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as 
            pets.Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,
            up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural 
            references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.[citation needed]Genetic studies have
            pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6] but the clade found in the
             Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia 
             in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the 
             "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose 
             III.In 2011 a study in genetic and archaeological[11] evidence conclude that the origin of the modern-day chicken is from South-East 
             Asia. This is the area east of India and south of China.
